    "# What are the most pressing concerns regarding ‘Climate Change’ among tweeters according to Topic Modeling? \n",
    "It's not new to us to hear the term ‘Climate Change’. A topic like Climate Change forces us to talk about both its causes and its effects. Among us, Climate Change is getting more and more awareness. But I'm going to talk about exactly what aspects of Climate Change concern us the most with the help of a tweet data set and how much this matters today since climate change is a multidimensional subject. In this paper, I intend to demonstrate whether we commoners are neglecting the most pressing threats while we are focusing on other concerns. Climate Change affects our organization in almost every aspect of our lives, from organizational to economic to environmental. Which topic has been selected by the majority of tweeters compared to other topics among these aspects?"

    "# A theoretical framework for topic modeling\n",
    "Based on the assumption that each topic is a mixture of over a set of underlying words, and that each document is a mixture of over a set of topic probabilities, the LDA is a generative probabilistic model.\n",
    "In the field of machine learning (ML) or statistics, dimensionality reduction is a method that relates to reducing the number of random variables in a problem by obtaining a set of principal variables that can be used to solve the problem.\n",
    "As in clustering, the number of topics is a parameter that is used as an output parameter in unsupervised learning, since the number of topics, just like the number of clusters, is a parameter in clustering. Instead of clustering texts, topic modeling builds clusters of words. A text then consists of all of these topics, with each topic weighing in differently.\n",
    "A collection of documents can be tagged with abstract \"topics\" that best represent the information they contain.\n",
    "The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm is a popular topic modeling algorithm for extracting hidden topics from large volumes of text. In LDA, each topic is assumed to be a mixture of words, and each document is assumed to be a mixture of topics.\n",
    "Parameters of LDA:\n",
    "An alpha parameter represents a document's topic density. The higher the alpha will be, the more topics there will be in the document, and the more specific the topic distribution will be.\n",
    "In the same way, the beta parameter measures the number of words required to make up a topic. With high beta, topics are assumed to contain the majority of the words, resulting in a more specific distribution of words per topic.\n",
    "It is, however, difficult to find a topic that is clear, segregated and meaningful, as this depends heavily on the quality of text preprocessing as well as finding the optimal number of topics (machine learning). \n",

    "The Clean and Removing Noise feature helps to find and eliminate unhelpful parts of the data as well as removing punctuation marks, stop words, and typing errors that are present in the data. The feature converts all characters to lowercase, removes punctuation marks, and removes stop words. While it might be overlooked, the simplest and most effective method of preprocessing text is by lowercasing all of text data. Generally, it is applicable to most text mining and natural language processing problems. It also contributes significantly to maintaining consistency in the outputs. There are a number of stop words in English, including \"a\", \"the\", \"is\", \"are\" and so on. By eliminating low-information words from the text, stop word removal enables us to focus on the key words(https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/04/text-preprocessing-nlp-machine-learning.html). In the down cell stopwords have been removed with the help NLTK library."

A computer can also use these features as features as part of a machine learning pipeline in order to trigger more complex decisions or behaviors. Additionally, computers can use them directly to trigger useful actions and responses. Tokenization is an important step in contextual embedding models, including transformer-based models (Vaswani et al., 2017) and BERT models (Devlin et al., 2018) in order to solve problems such as out-of-vocabulary issues.

    "In pyLDAvis package’s interactive chart, an appropriate topic model will have a substantial number of large, non-overlapping bubbles distributed throughout the chart instead of being clustered in a single quadrant. A graph that depicts a model with many topics overlaid on each other typically see bubbles of small sizes clustered together in one area of the chart. If we move your mouse over one of the bubbles, we will see the words and bars on the right-hand side update to reflect the changes. The salient keywords that comprise the selected topic are those that form the core of the topic. Having beforehand known how many natural topics were contained in the document, identifying the best model was relatively straightforward."

    "In cluster 1, I receive a set of topics that make no sense to me; tokens such as 'see', 'com', 'reply', 'org', 'get', etc. alone cannot provide any useful information. The two main topics that are predominant here are 'climate' and 'change'. Nevertheless, when moving my cursor to cluster 2, several topics, including 'temperature,' 'work,' 'food,' 'health,' 'environment,' 'price,' 'cost,', and so on, seem to make sense to some extent, however, we are still unable to identify the broad aspect. Still, we can conclude from this cluster that services are dependent on the environment, or that environment has a significant bearing on those services. \n",
    "In spite of the fact that other clusters, except for clusters 1 and 2, overlap with each other, when I move to cluster 3, topics become more interesting and of greater significance. These topics include energy, oil, fire, fuel, destruction, and industry. An indication of political involvement can be found in Cluster 6, 17. Some of the environment relared terms like river, snow, valley, biodiversity, mine, paper, natural disaster appear in cluster 15.\n",

    "In any form of communication or expression, sentiment plays an important role. In spite of the fact that I chose topic modeling hoping to be able to extract multiple topics that are directly or indirectly related to climate change or environmental issues, the key words I derive from each topic serve mostly as auxiliary words. Those key words/tokens/topics do not evoke any sentiment of concern. By using lexicon-based sentiment analysers in the future, not only will we be able to get closer to subjectivity and factualness of data, but we will also be able to analyse polarity of topics."
